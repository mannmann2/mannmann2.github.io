They both, Svidrigaïlov and Achilles, stared at each other for a few minutes without speaking. At last it struck Achilles as irregular for a man not drunk to be standing three steps from him, staring and not saying a word.  
‘What do you want here?’ he said, without moving or changing his position.  
‘Nothing, brother, good morning,’ answered Svidrigaïlov.  
‘This isn’t the place.’  
‘I am going to foreign parts, brother.’  
‘To foreign parts?’  
‘To America.’  
‘America.’  
Svidrigaïlov took out the revolver and cocked it. Achilles raised his eyebrows.  
‘I say, this is not the place for such jokes!’  
‘Why shouldn’t it be the place?’  
‘Because it isn’t.’  
‘Well, brother, I don’t mind that. It’s a good place. When you are asked, you just say he was going, he said, to America.’  
He put the revolver to his right temple.  
‘You can’t do it here, it’s not the place,’ cried Achilles, rousing himself, his eyes growing bigger and bigger.  
Svidrigaïlov pulled the trigger.
